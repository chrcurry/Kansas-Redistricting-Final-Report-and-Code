Our Operations Research final project involved our team using Linear Programming to determine the optimal arrangement for Kansas' 4 congressional districts.  You should read our Project Report for the details on the proposed solution and the methods used. The code/all files used are also included in order to keep our project clear and concise for other people to view if they need to reference it.
The Kansas county graph is taken from Daryl DeFord's website, and the Kansas shapefiles are taken from Eugene Lykhovyd's website. Both sites contain all 50 U.S. states and we were given this information by our professor.
